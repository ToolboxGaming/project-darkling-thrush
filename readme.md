# Setup

* Install Unity 5.x
* Put Unity's `UnityYAMLMerge` program on your $PATH
* Instal Git LFS
* Checkout concept.md
* That's mostly it
    * You'll need a 3d modeler, preferably Blender.
    * You'll also need texturing tools (Blender can help). GIMP or Photoshop will be useful. There are more specialized tools but the good ones require commercial licenses (~$150).
    * These tools won't be strictly necessary for a while, though.
